## Annoyances

1. **Manual Build Triggers**  
   Major updates can be triggered manually if needed.  (by me)
2. **Different Signatures**  
   This build uses different signing keys from the official version. As a result:
   - You cannot install both versions simultaneously.  
   - Installing one prevents the other from updating.  
3. **No Empty Releases**  
   Builds are skipped if there are no new commits during the week.
