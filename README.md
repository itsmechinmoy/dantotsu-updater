# Hourly Preview Release of Dantotsu

> [!NOTE]
> - This repository **automatically compiles** the upstream **dev branch** of the official Dantotsu project:  
> ➡️ [rebelonion/Dantotsu (dev branch)](https://git.rebelonion.dev/rebelonion/Dantotsu/src/branch/dev)
> 
> - Every hour, the workflow checks for upstream commits.  
> If new changes are detected → a fresh APK is built and released.
> 
> - All development is done by [**rebelonion**](https://git.rebelonion.dev/rebelonion) and the [official contributors](https://git.rebelonion.dev/rebelonion/Dantotsu/activity/contributors).  
> This repo **does not modify** any source code — it only automates builds for quick access to the newest dev updates.
> 
> - You can add this build to [**Obtainium**](https://apps.obtainium.imranr.dev/redirect?r=obtainium://app/%7B%22id%22%3A%22ani.dantotsu%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fitsmechinmoy%2Fdantotsu-updater%22%2C%22author%22%3A%22itsmechinmoy%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22Dantotsu%22%2C%22preferredApkIndex%22%3A0%2C%22additionalSettings%22%3A%22%7B%5C%22includePrereleases%5C%22%3Atrue%2C%5C%22fallbackToOlderReleases%5C%22%3Atrue%2C%5C%22filterReleaseTitlesByRegEx%5C%22%3A%5C%22%5C%22%2C%5C%22filterReleaseNotesByRegEx%5C%22%3A%5C%22%5C%22%2C%5C%22verifyLatestTag%5C%22%3Atrue%2C%5C%22sortMethodChoice%5C%22%3A%5C%22date%5C%22%2C%5C%22useLatestAssetDateAsReleaseDate%5C%22%3Afalse%2C%5C%22releaseTitleAsVersion%5C%22%3Afalse%2C%5C%22trackOnly%5C%22%3Afalse%2C%5C%22versionExtractionRegEx%5C%22%3A%5C%22%5C%22%2C%5C%22matchGroupToUse%5C%22%3A%5C%22%5C%22%2C%5C%22versionDetection%5C%22%3Atrue%2C%5C%22releaseDateAsVersion%5C%22%3Afalse%2C%5C%22useVersionCodeAsOSVersion%5C%22%3Afalse%2C%5C%22apkFilterRegEx%5C%22%3A%5C%22%5C%22%2C%5C%22invertAPKFilter%5C%22%3Afalse%2C%5C%22autoApkFilterByArch%5C%22%3Atrue%2C%5C%22appName%5C%22%3A%5C%22%5C%22%2C%5C%22appAuthor%5C%22%3A%5C%22%5C%22%2C%5C%22shizukuPretendToBeGooglePlay%5C%22%3Afalse%2C%5C%22allowInsecure%5C%22%3Afalse%2C%5C%22exemptFromBackgroundUpdates%5C%22%3Afalse%2C%5C%22skipUpdateNotifications%5C%22%3Afalse%2C%5C%22about%5C%22%3A%5C%22%5C%22%2C%5C%22refreshBeforeDownload%5C%22%3Afalse%2C%5C%22github-creds%5C%22%3A%5C%22%5C%22%7D%22%2C%22overrideSource%22%3A%22GitHub%22%7D).

## Notes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This repository **is not a fork**.  
> - All source code belongs to the original developers.  
> - This repo only compiles the latest upstream dev branch.

> [!WARNING]
> - **This build uses different signing keys** than the official Dantotsu app.  
> You **cannot** install both versions at once.  
> Switching requires uninstalling the other.
>
> - Builds are only created when new upstream commits exist — no empty releases.
>
> - Builds can be manually triggered if needed (useful for debugging or testing upstream changes quickly).

> [!TIP]
> **Developers:**  
> - You can use these auto-built APKs for testing your Dantotsu code changes.  
> - To contribute or develop Dantotsu itself, request access to the Forgejo repo from  
> [**rebelonion**](https://git.rebelonion.dev/rebelonion) by joining the **official Discord**.
